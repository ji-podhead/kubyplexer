# Kubyplexer
> a funky cli tool to manage your cluster!
 
| planned features | prototype |
| ------------------- | --------- |
|- cli tool with mouse and arrow input <br> - manage your cluster with style without the need of exposing ports <br> <br> - autogenerate commands from selection => edit and execute   <br> <br> - double click a window for fullscreen <br> <br> - start your dashboards with one click <br> <br> - click on a history object in the kubehistory to select, edit and execute <br> <br> - use shift to cycle through the windows, release shift and scroll via arrows <br> <br> - remove selection to get general commands, like get pods <br> <br> - write manifest directly in the multiplexer | ![preview](https://github.com/ji-soft/kubyplexer/blob/main/kubyplexer_noinfo.png?raw=true) |

# motivation
- Increase the kubernetes workflow baby!
- I think this could be a really cool project, and I believe it's a project where many people, especially beginners, can benefit from

# roadmap
- find people to support me making this 
- decide wheather to use an actual multiplexer, or to build in c
- do it!

# connect
- You can find me via [Docker Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/HDnGNa68)
- i am "podhead", but in the react community you find me under "ji"
- dm is ok

# nodes
In Python, you can use the inspect module to find details and descriptions of classes and methods. You can even use it to execute a function generically. The getargspec function can be used to append constructor arguments and flags. However, I don't think that my planned project can be written in Python, since a multiplexer with mouse support requires a higher-level programming language like C. This can be quite an advanced and labor-intensive project.

I haven't written in C or Java for quite some time, so I'm not sure if I can do this alone.
