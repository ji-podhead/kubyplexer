# motivation
- Increase the kubernetes workflow baby!
- I think this could be a really cool project, and I believe it's a project where many people, especially beginners, can benefit from

# nodes
In Python, you can use the inspect module to find details and descriptions of classes and methods. You can even use it to execute a function generically. The getargspec function can be used to append constructor arguments and flags. However, I don't think that my planned project can be written in Python, since a multiplexer with mouse support requires a higher-level programming language like C. This can be quite an advanced and labor-intensive project.

I haven't written in C or Java for quite some time, so I'm not sure if I can do this alone.
